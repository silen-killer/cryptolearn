      <description>RSA is a widely-used public-key encryption system that is based on the mathematical properties of large prime numbers. It was one of the first practical public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission.
The RSA encryption process consists of two parts: key generation and encryption/decryption.
Key Generation:
Select two large prime numbers, p and q. Compute n = p*q. n is used as the modulus for both the public and private keys.</description>
